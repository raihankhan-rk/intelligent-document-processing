Inhalation:    If breathing is difficult, remove victim to fresh air and keep at rest in a position  comfortable for breathing. If casualty is unconscious and not breathing, or if  breathing is irregular or if respiratory arrest occurs, provide artificial respiration or  oxygen by trained personnel. If the casualty is unconscious and breathing, place in  the recovery position with the head below level of the torso. Immediately obtain  specialist medical assessment and treatment for the casualty.  Ingestion:    Obtain medical attention immediately. Do not wait for symptoms to develop. Do not  induce vomiting. Do not give anything by mouth because of risk of material entering  the lungs and causing lung damage. If person is drowsy or unconscious and vomiting,  place on left side with head down. If possible, do not leave unattended and observe  closely for adequacy of breathing.  Eye contact:   Remove contact lenses if present and easy to do. Wash eyes immediately with plenty  of water, making sure to rinse under eyelids. If symptoms persist, obtain medical  attention.  Skin contact:   Drench contaminated clothing with water before removing to avoid risk of sparks  from static electricity.  Take off contaminated clothing and wash it before reuse.   Wash with plenty of soap and water. If skin irritation occurs: Get medical  advice/attention.  For minor thermal burns, cool the burn. Hold the burned area under cold running  water for at least five minutes, or until the pain subsides. Body hypothermia must be  avoided.  Accidental high-pressure injection through the skin requires immediate medical  attention. Do not wait for symptoms to develop.  Protection of first aiders:   No action shall be taken involving any personal risk or without suitable training.    Ensure adequate ventilation. Spillages make surface slippery.     4.2   MOST IMPORTANT SYMPTOMS AND EFFECTS, BOTH ACUTE AND DELAYED ",

If material enters lungs, signs and symptoms may include coughing, choking, wheezing, difficulty in breathing,  chest congestion, shortness of breath, and/or fever.

Breathing of high vapour concentrations may cause central nervous system (CNS) depression resulting in drowsiness,  dizziness, light headedness, headache, disorientation, fatigue, nausea and loss of coordination. The onset of respiratory  symptoms may be delayed for several hours after exposure.   Eye contact may cause redness and transient pain.   Skin irritation signs and symptoms may include a burning sensation, redness, swelling, and/or blisters.

Use explosion-proof electrical, ventilating  and lighting equipment. Use only non-sparkling tools. Take precautionary measures against static discharge.     Use only outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. Provide adequate ventilation, including local extraction, to ensure  occupational exposure limits are not exceeded. Avoid breathing vapours/spray. Avoid contact with skin and eyes. Wear  suitable personal protective equipment (See Section 8).  Open container slowly.  The vapor is heavier than air and may  create an explosive mixture of vapor and air. Beware of accumulation in confined spaces and low-lying areas.  Do not  enter confined spaces such as tanks or pits without following proper entry procedures.     Do not eat, drink or smoke in the vicinity of the product. Wash thoroughly after handling. Take off contaminated  clothing and wash it before reuse. Contaminated clothing should be thoroughly cleaned or disposed of as hazardous  waste.    7.2   CONDITIONS FOR SAFE STORAGE, INCLUDING ANY INCOMPATIBILITIES  ",

The  competence of the collector or contractor to deal satisfactorily with this type of  product should be established beforehand. Do not dispose into the environment, in  drains or in watercourses. Do not dispose of tank water bottoms by allowing them to  drain into the ground. This will result in soil and groundwater contamination.   PRODUCT DISPOSAL  Dispose of waste to licensed waste disposal site in accordance with the requirements  of the local Waste Disposal Authority.      European Waste Code: 13 07 01* fuel oil and diesel    NOTE:  This code has been assigned based upon the most common uses for this  material and may not reflect contaminants resulting from actual use. Waste  generators/producers are responsible for assessing the actual process used when  generating the waste and its contaminants in order to assign the proper waste  disposal code.  PACKAGING DISPOSAL  Waste packaging should be recycled wherever possible. Send to drum recycler or  metal reclaimer. Care should be taken when handling emptied containers that have  not been cleaned out. Drain container thoroughly. After draining, vent in a safe place  away from sparks and fire. Residues may cause an explosion hazard if heated above  the flash point. Do not puncture, cut or weld uncleaned drums. Do not pollute the  soil, water or environment with the waste container. Comply with any local recovery   or waste disposal regulations. Incineration or landfill should only be considered when  recycling is not feasible.   LOCAL LEGISLATION:  Disposal should be in accordance with applicable regional, national, and local laws  and regulations. Local regulations may be more stringent than regional or national  requirements and must be complied with Hazardous Waste (England and Wales)  Regulations 2005    SECTION 14.
